    <p>
        STEP exams are a pair of 2 exams run by The University of Cambridge used to test the aptitude for undergraduate maths applicants for places at Cambridge, UCL, Warwick and various other universities.
    </p>
    <h3>
        STEP technical details:
    </h3>    
    <ul>
        <li>There are two STEP exams. STEP II covers A level maths content and AS level Further maths content. STEP III covers both the entirety of A level Further and Single Maths; both exams are designed to be equally difficult. </li>
        <li>There are 12 questions; 8 pure, 2 mechanics and 2 statistics & probability.</li>
        <li>Students choose 6 of these 12 questions to do, with no restriction of choice</li>
        <li>The paper is 3 hours long, and each question is worth 20 marks; the distribution of these marks within these questions are not shown</li>
        <li>The paper is graded with grades U 3 2 1 S, with S being the highest.</li>
        <li>Results of STEP are released the midnight of A-Level results day.</li>

    <h3>
        History of STEP:
    </h3>    
    <ul>
        STEP stands for 'Sixth Term Examination Paper' and was originally part of a wide group of STEP papers for various subjects. 
        However, only the mathematics paper has remained since 2002. Most archives have STEP papers dating from 1987. 
        STEP had 16 questions per paper until 1994. From 1994 to 2007 (inclusive), it had 14 questions. From 2008 to 2018 (inclusive), STEP had 13 questions.
        2019 not only saw the loss of a 13th question, but also the removal of a formulae booklet, and the discontinuation of STEP I, which was based solely on the Single Maths A-Level.
        Stephen Siklos, the founder of STEP, ran the paper until his unfortunate passing in 2019.
        Historically, the grade of 'S' was to indicate a scholarship for applicants in the past; it no longer holds this value. STEP also has a notoriety for having very
        few mistakes in its papers. The earliest there was a misprint for STEP was in 2015.

        Will I run out of space in the formula booklet?
    </button>
    <hr>
    <section class="collapsible_content">
       No. The booklet is 22 pages large (44 sides); it is highly unlikely you will run out of space. The <a class="inline_minipage" href="https://www.admissionstesting.org/for-test-takers/step/preparing-for-step/">official STEP website</a> has a sample page if you wish to practice with them.

        STEP clashes with an A-level, is this a problem?
    </button>
    <hr>
    <section class="collapsible_content">
        No, STEP III often conflicts with Chemistry A-Levels; your institution should place you as a clash candidate (whereby you complete one exam after the other, being isolated between them).

    <button class="collapsible">
        How many people take STEP?
    </button>
    <hr>
    <section class="collapsible_content">
        Approximately 2000 for STEP II, and 1000 for STEP III. Despite both being equally difficult, less people know the content for STEP III (as it is A-level Further Maths).

    <button class="collapsible">
        Should I  get a tutor?
    </button>
    <hr>
    <section class="collapsible_content">
        Many people get a tutor for STEP, and it is important you ensure that you (a) pick a good tutor (because a lot of tutors charge a lot of money for giving freely available information) and (b) that you pick a tutor for the right reason. The best use of a tutor is likely to help teach you topics you don't know (e.g stats if you don't do it in further maths). Content specific skills and exam technique varies from person to person or is freely available online.
